# Nodes
Calian GNSS ROS 2 package contains multiple nodes. One or more nodes are used at a time to use Calian GNSS Smart antenna in different configurations.
### :one: GPS
The GPS node is responsible for the configuration of Calian GNSS Smart antenna based on the mode of operation and publishing location data, antenna feedback to the respective topics. It takes the **Log parameters** and **Config parameters** (Described in the Parameters section) as the input parameters.
- Node arguments: Operating Mode (Accepted values are ****)
### :two: PointPerfect
The PointPerfect node is responsible to provide [PPP-RTK](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/pointperfect) GNSS correction data to the Calian GNSS Smart antenna. It publishes the correction data to the **"corrections"** topic. It takes the  **Log parameters** and **Pointperfect parameters** as the input parameters.
### :three: Ntrip
The Ntrip node is responsible to provide RTCM GNSS correction data to the Calian GNSS Smart antenna. It publishes the correction data to the **"corrections"** topic. It takes the **Log parameters** and **Ntrip parameters** as the input parameters.
### :four: Remote Message Handler
The RTCM Remote Message Handler node is responsible for providing RTCM messages from Ably to the Calian GNSS Smart antenna. From our windows **TruPrecision** Application, A Base can be setup at a static location and RTCM corrections can be published onto the remote ably server. Those messages can be transmitted to the antennas using this node. It takes the **Config parameters** as the input parameters.
### :five: GPS Visualizer
The GPS Visualizer node visualizes the location data of the Calian GNSS Smart antenna published in the **gps** topic onto the map.
### :six: Unique Id Finder
The Unique Id Finder node extracts the unique id of the antenna from the SEC-UNIQID Ubx message. It assumes the antennas have the default baudrate (230400).

# PointPerfect Setup

To achieve centimeter-level accuracy in real-time, PPP-RTK corrections are essential. These corrections can be obtained through the Pointperfect subscription service, accessible at **`https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/pointperfect`**. Follow the steps below to acquire and configure the necessary files:
- Visit the website to subscribe to the Pointperfect service.
- Once subscribed, navigate to the "Credentials" tab under the "Location Thing Details" section on the website.
- Download the ucenter configuration file provided and rename it to **`ucenter-config.json`**.

- Create a new folder named **`pointperfect_files`** at the following directory: **`humble_ws/src/calian_gnss_ros2/pointperfect_files/`**.

- Place the **`ucenter-config.json`** file inside the newly created **`pointperfect_files`** folder.
- When you run the node, it will generate several files within the **`pointperfect_files`** folder, which are necessary for establishing a connection to the subscription service.

# Installation

To install Calian GNSS ROS2, follow these steps:

1. **ROS Workspace:** Move to your ROS2 workspace (example: mine is humble_ws)

   ```bash
    cd ~/humble_ws/src
    ```

2. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Calian-gnss/calian-gnss-ros2-drivers.git
    ```
   
3. **Build the package using colcon:**

    ```bash
    cd ~/humble_ws
    colcon build
    ```

4. **source the setup file:**

    ```bash
    source install/setup.bash
    ```

5. Go to your project, and install requirements.txt for installing all the required libraries at once. (for exampe mine is under humble_ws/src/Calian_ros2)

    ```bash
    cd humble_ws/src/calian_gnss_ros2
    pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

  ```diff
  + IMP NOTE: Source your package every time you make change or open a new terminal. 

  + Else you will see Error like <<Package 'calian_gnss_ros2' not found>> even if you have cloned it.

  ```

# Usage

The Calian GNSS ROS2 package provides flexibility in its configurations, and example launch files for different setups can be found in the **`launch`** folder (**`/src/calian_gnss_ros2/launch/`**). The package includes the **`gps_visualizer`** node, designed to run alongside the **`gps`** node, enabling the visualization of the published location data. Ensure to change the **`unique_id`** parameter in the launch files to the desired gnss receiver.

## :one: Basic configuration.

- To use corrections, Ensure the params file is changed accordingly.
- If PointPerfect needs to be used as correction source, The steps mentioned in the PointPerfect Setup sections needs to be performed. If Ntrip needs to be used as correction source, The ntrip parameters needs to be changed to supply ntrip configuration.
- Set the parameters in the params file (`src/calian_gnss_ros2/params/`):
  - **`use_corrections`** to True if the corrections service needs to be used.
  - **`corrections_source` to either `Ntrip` or `PointPerfect`
- Build the workspace using **`colcon build`** and source the setup file with **`source install/setup.bash`**. Repeat this step for any changes in the launch file.
- Launch the nodes using the following command:
   ```
   ros2 launch calian_gnss_ros2 disabled.launch.py
   ```

- Upon execution, the **`Calian_gps`** node starts in disabled configuration, publishing location data to the **`gps`** topic.
- The visualizer node is also initiated, and you can view the mapped location data at **http://localhost:8080**.

- **Note**: You can modify the default port number (8080) of the visualizer node by adjusting the **`port`** parameter in the launch file.

## :two: Moving Baseline configuration:

For the Moving Baseline configuration, which involves two Calian antennas (one base and one rover), and only antennas with Zed-f9p chips acting as the base:

- Follow similar steps as the RTK disabled configuration and make necessary changes to the params file.
- Build and source the terminal.
- Launch the nodes with the command:

   ```
   ros2 launch calian_gnss_ros2 moving_baseline.launch.py
   ```
- Upon execution, the Calian_gps nodes start in Base and Rover modes in moving baseline configuration, publishing location data to the **`gps`** topic and extended information like heading, quality and accuracies to **`gps_extended`** topics.
- Access the location data at **http://localhost:8080**.
- Ensure to have clear skies to get good precision values.

## :three: Static Baseline configuration:

For the Static Baseline configuration, which involves one Calian antenna setup using [TruPrecision](https://tallysman.com/downloads/TruPrecision.zip) as base at a known location and one or more devices/robots with one antenna acting as rovers connected to the Base.

- Make sure to use the same key used for the TruPrecision (Prefilled do not change unless if you have a separate source). Change the channel name to the one given in TruPrecision application.
- Build and source the terminal.
- Launch the nodes with the command:
   ```
   ros2 launch calian_gnss_ros2 static_baseline.launch.py
   ```
- Upon execution, The remote rtcm corrections handler and Calian_gps nodes start in Rover mode in static baseline configuration, publishing location data to the **`gps`** topic and extended information like heading, quality and accuracies to **`gps_extended`** topics.
- Access the location data at **http://localhost:8080**.
- Ensure to have clear skies to get good precision values.
To view active topics use command
```bash
ros2 topic list
```
