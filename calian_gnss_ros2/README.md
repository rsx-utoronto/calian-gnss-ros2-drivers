     - `(NotSet: 0, Debug: 10, Info: 20, Warn: 30, Error: 40, Critical: 50)`.
### :two: Config parameters:
Path: `src/calian_gnss_ros2/params/config.yaml`
1. **`unique_id (string)`:**
   - Unique Id of Calian Gnss receiver. Run the `Unique_id_finder` node (assumes default baudrate) to get the unique ids of all connected antennas.
2. **`baud_rate (integer)`:**
   - Baud rate for serial communication. Default value should be 230400.

### :three: Pointperfect parameters

   - Flag indicating whether PPP-RTK corrections should be used.

2. **`config_path (string)`:**
   - Path to PPP-RTK configuration file.

3. **`region (string)`:**
   - Region information. Accepted values are `us, eu, kr, au`.

## :gear: Operating Modes

The Calian GNSS antenna can be operated in different modes based on configuration. The mode of operation cannot be changed when the node is running. It must be passed as an argument in the launch file.


### :one: Disabled Mode:

- **Description:** This mode works as a standalone node. Any Calian Gnss antenna can work in this mode.
- **Functionality:** Connects to the Calian Gnss antenna and publishes GPS data (latitude and longitude) on the `gps` topic with the message type NavSatFix. Complete Gnss receiver signal status is provided in the topic `gps_extended` with the message type GnssSignalStatus (Depends on calian_gnss_ros2_msg package)
- **Launch File:** `calian_gnss_ros2/launch/disabled.launch.py`
- **Launch Arguments:** `arguments=['Disabled']`

### :two: Heading_Base Mode:

- **Description:** Part of the moving baseline configuration. Calian antennas equipped with Zed-f9p will only work in this mode.
- **Functionality:** Connects to the serial port of the Calian antenna and publishes Rtcm corrections on the "rtcm_corrections" topic. This topic is intended for internal use by the respective rover nodes.
- **Launch File:** `Calian_ros2/launch/moving_baseline.launch.py`
- **Launch Arguments:** `arguments=['Heading_Base']`

### :three: Rover Mode:

- **Description:** Can be used in both moving baseline configuration and static baseline configuration. Calian antennas equipped with Zed-f9p/Zed-f9r(Doesn't work in moving baseline configuration only f9p does) will only work in this mode.
- **Functionality:** Connects to the serial port of the Calian antenna, subscribes to the "rtcm_corrections" topic created by the base node.
- **Requirements:** Requires another node running with Heading_Base or Static_Base.
- **Launch Arguments:** `arguments=['Rover']`

It's crucial to configure the launch files with the appropriate parameters and arguments based on the desired mode of operation. Additionally, ensure that the necessary dependencies are met and the topic names are unique for the antennas in same configuration.

## :round_pushpin: PointPerfect Setup

To achieve centimeter-level accuracy in real-time, PPP-RTK corrections are essential. These corrections can be obtained through the Pointperfect subscription service, accessible at **`https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/pointperfect`**. Follow the steps below to acquire and configure the necessary files:
- Visit the website to subscribe to the Pointperfect service.
- Once subscribed, navigate to the "Credentials" tab under the "Location Thing Details" section on the website.
- Download the ucenter configuration file provided and rename it to **`ucenter-config.json`**.

- Create a new folder named **`pointperfect_files`** at the following directory: **`humble_ws/src/calian_gnss_ros2/pointperfect_files/`**.

- Place the **`ucenter-config.json`** file inside the newly created **`pointperfect_files`** folder.
- When you run the node, it will generate several files within the **`pointperfect_files`** folder, which are necessary for establishing a connection to the subscription service.

# :rocket: Installation

To install Calian GNSS ROS2, follow these steps:


1. **ROS Workspace:** Move to your ROS2 workspace (example: mine is humble_ws)

   ```bash
    cd ~/humble_ws/src
    ```

2. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Calian-gnss/calian-gnss-ros2-drivers.git
    ```
   
3. **Build the package using colcon:**

    cd ~/humble_ws
    colcon build
    ```

4. **source the setup file:**

    ```bash
    source install/setup.bash
    ```

5. Go to your project, and install requirements.txt for installing all the required libraries at once. (for exampe mine is under humble_ws/src/Calian_ros2)

    ```bash
    cd humble_ws/src/calian_gnss_ros2
    pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

  ```diff

  + Else you will see Error like <<Package 'calian_gnss_ros2' not found>> even if you have cloned it.

  ```

# :books: Usage

The Calian GNSS ROS2 package provides flexibility in its configurations, and example launch files for different setups can be found in the **`launch`** folder (**`/src/calian_gnss_ros2/launch/`**). The package includes the **`gps_visualizer`** node, designed to run alongside the **`gps`** node, enabling the visualization of the published location data. Ensure to change the **`unique_id`** parameter in the launch files to the desired gnss receiver.

## :one: RTK disabled configuration.

- TO use corrections, Ensure the presence of the **`config_file.json`** in the designated location, as specified in the PPP-RTK corrections setup section.
- Set the parameters in the launch file:
  - **`use_corrections`** to True if the corrections service needs to be used.
  - **`config_path`** to 'src/calian_gnss_ros2/pointperfect_files/ucenter_config_file.json'
  - **`region`** to the desired region
- Build the workspace using **`colcon build`** and source the setup file with **`source install/setup.bash`** and your ROS setup. Repeat this step for any changes in the launch file.
- Launch the nodes using the following command:
   ```
   ros2 launch calian_gnss_ros2 disabled.launch.py
   ```

- Upon execution, the **`Calian_gps`** node starts in disabled configuration, publishing location data to the **`gps`** topic.
- The visualizer node is also initiated, and you can view the mapped location data at **http://localhost:8080**.

- **Note**: You can modify the default port number (8080) of the visualizer node by adjusting the **`port`** parameter in the launch file.

## :two: RTK-Moving Baseline configuration:

For the RTK-Moving Baseline configuration, which involves two Calian antennas (one base and one rover), and only antennas with Zed-f9p chips acting as the base:

- Follow similar steps as the RTK disabled configuration and make necessary changes to the launch file.
- Build and source the terminal.
- Launch the nodes with the command:

   ```
   ros2 launch calian_gnss_ros2 moving_baseline.launch.py
   ```
- Upon execution, the Calian_gps nodes start in Base and Rover modes in moving baseline configuration, publishing location data to the **`gps`** topic and extended information like heading, quality and accuracies to **`gps_extended`** topics.
- Access the location data at **http://localhost:8080**.
- Ensure to have clear skies to get good precision values.

## :three: RTK-Static Baseline configuration:

For the RTK-Static Baseline configuration, which involves one Calian antenna setup using TruPrecision as base at a known location and one or more devices/robots with one antenna acting as rovers connected to the Base.

- Make sure to use the same key used for the TruPrecision (Prefilled do not change unless if you have a separate source). Change the channel name to the one given in TruPrecision application.
- Build and source the terminal.
- Launch the nodes with the command:
   ```
   ros2 launch calian_gnss_ros2 static_baseline.launch.py
   ```
- Upon execution, The remote rtcm corrections handler and Calian_gps nodes start in Rover mode in static baseline configuration, publishing location data to the **`gps`** topic and extended information like heading, quality and accuracies to **`gps_extended`** topics.
- Access the location data at **http://localhost:8080**.
- Ensure to have clear skies to get good precision values.
To view active topics use command
```bash
ros2 topic list
```
